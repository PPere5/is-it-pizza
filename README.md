# is-it-pizza

App that connects to laptop camera and predicts if it is being shown pizza
or not. The idea is to web scrape images to create a training set and use it to train a CNN
model built with keras. Object detection and image manipulation are mainly achieved using
opencv, while the model is served using 
ask. Currently I am still improving on my model
however the app already works functionally using a YOLOv3 model trained in the COCO
dataset. Working on this project involved using python modules such as scikit-learn, Keras,
TensorFlow, opencv, 
ask as well as web languages such as HTML and JS.
